    - The GT font is being used for some headers. Inter font is being used for the rest of the website. Helvetica & Sans Serif are used as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into thr website correctly. Both GT & Inter are clean and simple fonts.
  
  - #### Imagery
    - There are few images used in this website. There is a large background image at the top to catch the viewers attention. There are also smaller images below with navigation links to other parts of the website.
